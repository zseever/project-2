# Project 2 - Daily Stocks
Daily Stocks is an app that displays some of the most popular stocks in chart form on the front page that automatically updates each day via API fetch. Alongside this functionality, you can click into each of those stocks or manually look up a stock to get company information such as a description, website, # of employyes, etc.

There is also functionality to log in and this unlocks 2 new features - Watchlists and Portfolio. You are able to add stocks to a watchlist to see their current price, daily price change, and daily volume. The portfolio has some similar functionality, but allows you to enter in the amount of shares and price paid for stocks you own. It then displays this information and also calculates your profit or loss for each stock, as well as a total.
